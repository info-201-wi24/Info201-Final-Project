 p("This is why despite our initial hypotheses, the numerous socioeconomic factors complicates the relationship between these two variables."),
 
 p("While it's tempting to draw direct correlations between childhood obesity rates and household income levels,
   our findings suggest otherwise. Just because there was some correlation between the two variables, it was not
   enough to determine a causation. The multifaceted nature of socioeconomic conditions, including access to healthy
   food options, educational opportunities, healthcare resources, and even genetics, introduces significant complexity into our analysis."),
 
 p("The research required to draw a causation between childhood obesity rates and household income levels requires
   the research of several factors. With so many different factors at play, it is hard to determine the exact cause
   of childhood obesity and even if we could, we cannot say with 100 percent certainty that it is due to only one variable."),
 
 p("Therefore, as we conclude our study, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of oversimplified interpretations and recognize
   the need for multifaceted approaches to addressing childhood obesity. Public health policies and interventions must take into account the
   intricate web of determinants that influence health outcomes. By understanding and addressing these factors, we can better serve the diverse
   needs of communities and work towards achieving equitable health outcomes for all children."),
 
 p("In essence, while our research may not provide clear-cut answers regarding the correlation between childhood obesity and household income,
   it shows the importance of considering all of the socioeconomic variables at play. Our research process has highlighted the necessity of holistic,
   inclusive approaches when tackling the challenges of childhood obesity.")
